        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>My mother is an artist and usually shares her art in art shows or by posting pictures on Facebook. As a gift for Mother's Day my sister and I teamed up to build her a site that would display her art beautifully so she could easily share with family and friends. </p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I was the only developer working on this project as my sister's role was to take pictures of the art. I wanted the site to be simple so that the focus would be the actual art. I still wanted the site to be clean, responsive, and of course, good-looking. I took this on as a side project and got it up in just a few weekends.</p>
        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <p>I used HTML, CSS, Sass, and some jQuery in this site. I had recently worked on a Bower package that I installed on this project because it has a well-organized (inspired by MVC) file structure for Sass. Grid Systems and Responsive Design were top priorities when working on this so mobile users would be able to enjoy the site just as much as desktop users. I also utilized Photoshop a great deal for this site to make sure all the art photos were of optimal quality. </p>
